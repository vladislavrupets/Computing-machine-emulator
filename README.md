A custom educational computer was developed based on the von Neumann architecture, with a set of instructions designed and implemented to enable input and output of data, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder calculation), as well as other commands to transfer data between memory locations, among other functions. All instructions execute sequentially, except for conditional and unconditional branching instructions, which can modify the program flow.
